Django Doc Wiki
===============

This is an extremely simple, document based wiki that can read and update
its contents from a given directory. It's meant to be used with a source 
control system that version the files separately. Currently no web editing
interface is included, it's just an easy way of displaying a bunch of markdown
formatted files in a directory.
