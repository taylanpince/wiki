iPhone Prototyping Best Practices ([[!taglink under_construction]])
==========================================================

Prototyping for the iPhone platform has its own unique challenges and is very
different from structuring a web application. Since the UI elements are
limited to what's offered by Apple, and every application on the platform has
to be adhere to their strict human interface guidelines, it's crucial to
get a feel of what iPhone applications are capable of, and how they should
be designed, before starting the process.

This document will serve as a hub for gathering together a few different
types of information:

- Prototyping methodologies for the iPhone platform

- Resources and tools that can be used in the process

- Real world examples of good interface elements and designs


Methodologies
-------------

The first document that should be read by everyone who is going to prototype,
design, or develop on the iPhone platform is Apple's Human Interface 
Guidelines. [Getting Started with User Experience](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/GS_UserExperience_iPhone/index.html)
provides a good starting point, and the [iPhone Human Interface Guidelines](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Introduction/Introduction.html) 
is where the rules are outlined. Apple vigurously tests every application 
submitted to the store against these rules, and most apps are rejected if they
don't meet the criteria.

If you are developer who is new to the platform, you should also read the 
[iPhone Application Programming Guide](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html), 
which provides a detailed overview of the whole process.


Resources
---------

Creating a prototype is one of the most important steps in an iPhone app's
development cycle. There are several different tools that can be used:

- [Graffle Stencils](http://graffletopia.com/search/iphone)
  Especially the [Ultimate iPhone Stencil](http://graffletopia.com/stencils/413) 
  is used by most

- [Yahoo Design Pattern Library](http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/wireframes/)
  provides resources for most common iPhone UI elements

- [iPhone GUI PSD](http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/?p=1628) is a Photoshop
  document that contains some of the most common UI elements

- [Prototyping Using Fireworks](http://unitid.nl/2009/04/prototyping-for-the-iphone-using-fireworks-cs3/) 
  is an alternative method for building interactive prototypes

- [LiveView](http://www.zambetti.com/projects/liveview/) is a desktop and
  iPhone app combination that lets you transmit anything on the desktop
  to the device and interact with it

- [Axure RP Widget Library for iPhone](http://www.axure.com/widgetLibraries.aspx) is available from Axure for Axure RP 5.5

- [If you love paper prototyping](http://www.designcommission.com/shop/iphone-stencil-kit) there's a fantastic metal draughting-style template for you!
