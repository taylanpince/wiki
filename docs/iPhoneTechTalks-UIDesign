iPhone UI Design Essentials by Eric Hope (ehope@apple.com)
==========================================================

## Elegant Solution

- Solve an actual problem
- Solve it elegantly
- Leave out anything that's not needed


## Clearly Defined Style

- Serious Tool:
	- Minimal graphics
	- Complex hierarchy
	- Keep it clean with alignment (everything is readable at a glance: colors, alignment, fonts, etc.)
	- Avoid visual redundancy
		- If something occurs more than twice on the screen, take it out (My Photos -> Photos, etc.)
	- Visually prioritize (important things should be at the top)

- Fun Tool:
	- Moderately graphically rich
		- Usually content is provided
	- Simple information hierarchy

- Fun Entertainment
	- Intensely graphical
		- Don't use standard navigation controls
	- Rarely hierarchical
		- Make the game easily reachable and playable, you don't know how much time the user has
	- Multitouch centric
		- It's natural to try and use two thumbs, multitouch should be available (more than one point of interaction)
	- Loud visual feedback
		- Give visual and audible rewards (bling), level of engagement will go up

- Serious Entertainment
	- Moderately graphical
	- Moderately hierarchical
	- Content consumption focused

- Utility
	- Graphically rich
		- Much like single use appliances, should be well designed to be successful
		- Easily legible from far away
	- Single screen
	- Efficiency focused
		- Large buttons
		- They are usually used in a hurry


## Great Usability

- Solid application hierarchy
	- Very linear (one door to one room)
	- Web modal doesn't work in a mobile app context (links from anywhere to everywhere)
	- Drill down a specific path
- Clean layout
	- More than just using padding and alignment
	- Good layout gives impression of stability
- Finger sized targets
	- 44px by 44px (on average)
	- 44px by 22px (never stacked vertically)


## Gorgeous Application Icon

- Legibility is paramount
	- As few distinct objects as possible
	- Clearly defined silhouette
	- Human eye parses shapes first
	- Don't put words inside of the icon, unless there is a good reason
- High quality art is a must
	- It should be as good when it's blown up to poster size
	- Lots of details
- Great icons tell a story
	- Personable
	- Suggests what the app is about
- Icon is the first and last impression
	- Should be professional


## High Fidelity UI

- Making it "iPhone-like"
	- Nail the basics first, then move on to adding polish
- Read the HIG
	- Don't treat it as a quick reference, really read through
	- Understand the essence of why a specific element was made for, then you can customize it
- Build a brand, tell a story
- Employ tactile design
	- Design elements that you would want to touch in the real world
	- Use rich materials (leather, metal, etc.), they don't cost you anything extra
- Hire, contract or become a designer
- Start with paper prototypes
	- Always begin by drawing on a piece of paper
	- Don't write UI code until you prototyped every screen


## Dynamic Content

- Every application needs a pulse
	- Without dynamic content, apps have a very short shelf life
	- Most apps on the mac are user-centric serious tools, so the burden of providing content is on the user
	- Combat staleness by providing an area that constantly changes in the app, people will relaunch it
- People love freshness
	- Make the app continually change
- People love improvement
	- Continous updates make people follow your app more
	- People read the update release notes, make sure you include lots of data in there
	- Add new features or little gems, then make people traverse the app to reach it
- People love people
	- High score boards, badges, trophies
	- Social communities can spring up around any topic, people love to share
	- Use social networking components (Facebook Connect, etc.)
- Use in-app purchase
	- Create a customized, attractive store
	- Don't underestimate people's interest in something they invested money for
- Always display the cost
- Give detailed descriptions
- Group items according to type
- Indicate when items are consumable
- Provide a "Check for purchases" button
	- If people change devices, they shouldn't lose the content they already bought


## Add Animation

- More realistic, approchable, fun
- Clarifies a process or concept
- Reflects result of action
	- Deleting
	- Moving
	- Revealing
	- Purchasing
	- Changing
	- Selecting
	- Customizing
- Use animation to:
	- Enhance a task
- Avoid:
	- Animating everything
	- Gratuitous animation
	- Distracting from the main task


## Sound, the forgotten frontier

- Sound can increase value
	- Sound can motivate the user
- Can reduce visual notice
	- Instead of animations, use sound to give feedback
- Must be relevant
	- If there is sound in one part of the app, make sure the rest follows
- Must be symmetrical
	- If a drawer makes a sound when it comes up, it should make a symmetrical sound when it goes down
- Make sure to have high quality sound
	- Especially for push notifications


## Polish

- Landscape mode
	- Often overlooked
	- Under the age of 25, most people use the device vertically
	- But over the age of 25 most people prefer landscape mode
- Contextual Interface Elements
	- Don't use the alert dialogs for everything, it should be for errors, or very important messages
	- Be subtle when giving visual feedback, especially if it's not essential
- Search and scope controls
- Spotlight and settings icons
	- 29px by 29px for spotlight icons
	- 57px by 57px for springboard icons
- Push notifications
	- Make sure it's sensible, don't notify the user for everything
	- Make sure it's done right from the very beginning
- Copy and paste
- Undo and redo
	- Don't let people accidentally undo things they can't take back
	- If undo is destructive, warn the user


## Application Definition Statement

- Avoid developing from lists of features
	- Don't cram a list of specs into one app
	- Define a solution
- ADS:
	- (Your differentiator) (your solution) for (your audience)
		i.e. Photos: Easy to use digital photo sharing for casual iPhone users
			 Aperture: Easy to use digital photo sharing for professional Mac users
- Feature filtering:
	- Pick the few features, most frequently used, by the majority of your users, most appropriate for the mobile platform
	- If a feature doesn't make it through this filter, let it go
